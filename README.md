## CloudX: AWS Practitioner for JS

### Assignment 2 â€“ Serving frontend application

#### Tasks

Manual Deployment:

- created and configured an S3 bucket
- built and manually uploaded the app to the created S3 bucket
- created CloudFront distribution for the app
- updated policy for previously created S3 bucket
- created and tested CloudFront invalidations and custom error page

Links after created CloudFront distribution and updated bucket policy:

- [S3-website](https://myshopfrontapp.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/) - shows 403 Access Denied error
- [CloudFront website](https://d1qqnb06cxsff6.cloudfront.net/) - site is served now with CloudFront and is available through the Internet over CloudFront URL

Automated Deployment

- installed and configured AWS CDK
- AWS CDK constructs are added and configured
- added necessary npm script(s) and code changes to synthesize, build and deploy app from local machine
- [CDK deployed website url](https://d1t0jc81ahdh84.cloudfront.net/)

## Steps for deployment

### Step 1: Build the React app

Navigate to the root directory of your React app and install dependencies.

#### `install`

Build the React app for production `dist` folder.

#### `build`

### Step 2: Install CDK Dependencies

Navigate to the cdk/ folder.

#### `cd cdk`

Install dependencies for the CDK project.

#### `install`

### Step 3: Bootstrap AWS Environment

Ensure you are in the cdk/ folder

#### `cd cdk`

Bootstrap your AWS environment

#### `cdk bootstrap`

If deploying to a specific AWS account and region, specify them explicitly

#### `cdk bootstrap aws://<account-id>/<region>`

### Step 4: Deploy the CDK Stack

Ensure you are in the cdk/ folder

#### `cd cdk`

Deploy the stack

#### `cdk deploy`

Wait for the deployment to complete. Once done, the terminal will output the S3 bucket URL or CloudFront URL.

## Cleaning up

### To delete all resources created by the CDK stack

Ensure you are in the cdk/ folder

#### `cd cdk`

Run the destroy command

#### `cdk destroy`
